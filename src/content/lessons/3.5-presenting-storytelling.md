# Presenting & Storytelling

## Introduction
You can have the best code or the best design in the world, but if you can't sell it, it dies. Storytelling is the algorithm for human attention. It creates emotional resonance that data alone cannot achieve.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Hero's Journey (Simplified)
Nancy Duarte's structure for great presentations:
- **What is**: "Here is the status quo. It sucks." (Problem)
- **What could be**: "Imagine a world where..." (Vision)
- ** The Gap**: How we cross from here to there. (Solution)

### 2. The Rule of 10/20/30
Guy Kawasaki's rule for pitch decks:
- **10 Slides** maximum.
- **20 Minutes** maximum.
- **30 Point Font** minimum. (Forces you to be brief).

### 3. Know Your Audience
- **Executives**: Want the bottom line, ROI, and risk. Be brief.
- **Engineers**: Want the "How", the specs, and the edge cases. Be detailed.
- **Customers**: Want to know "What's in it for me?"

## Activities
1.  **The Elevator Pitch**: Can you explain your semester project in 30 seconds to a stranger? Practice until you can.

## Assignment: The 3-Slide Pitch
You want your company to pay for a ChatGPT Plus subscription for your team.
- **Slide 1 (The Problem)**: Why are we slow right now?
- **Slide 2 (The Solution)**: How does this tool fix it?
- **Slide 3 (The Ask)**: How much is it, and what is the ROI?
- Submit the bullet points for these 3 slides.
