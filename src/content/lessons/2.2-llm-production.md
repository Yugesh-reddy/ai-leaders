# LLM Production

## Introduction
An empty WordPress editor can be intimidating. With LLMs, you never have to stare at a blinking cursor again. You can use AI to generate outlines, drafts, and even SEO metadata—but you must remain the Editor-in-Chief.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The "Human Sandwich"
- **Top Bun (Human)**: Strategy, Topic, Angle, Outline.
- **Meat (AI)**: drafting the paragraphs, generating ideas.
- **Bottom Bun (Human)**: Editing, Fact-checking, Formatting, Publishing.

### 2. Prompting for Structure
Don't just say "Write a post about dogs."
- **Say**: "Write a blog post about 'Corgi Care'. Use H2 headers for 'Feeding', 'Grooming', and 'Exercise'. Include a bulleted list for 'Best Toys'. Keep paragraphs under 3 sentences."

### 3. Cleaning "AI-isms"
AI loves certain words: "Delve," "Landscape," "Testament," "In conclusion."
- **Task**: Hunt these down and destroy them. Replace them with simple, punchy language.
- **Check**: Read the first sentence of every paragraph. Does it sound repetitive?

## Activities
1. **Title Generator**: "Give me 10 click-worthy titles for a blog post about [Topic]."
2. **Metadata**: "Write a meta description (under 160 characters) for this post."

## Assignment: AI-Assisted Article
1.  Choose a topic you know well.
2.  Use AI to generate an outline.
3.  Use AI to expand that outline into a draft.
4.  **Edit it**: Change at least 30% of the text to sound like YOU.
5.  Submit the final text and mention one specific "AI-ism" you removed.
