# Healthy Conflict

## Introduction
If everyone always agrees, someone is lying. Healthy conflict is how bad ideas are filtered out and good ideas are strengthened. The goal is not to avoid conflict, but to handle it without destroying relationships.

## Core Concepts

### 1. SBI Model (Feedback)
When you need to have a hard conversation, use **S-B-I**:
- **Situation**: "During the morning standup..." (Fact)
- **Behavior**: "...you interrupted me three times..." (Fact)
- **Impact**: "...which made me feel unheard and less likely to share my ideas." (Result)
- **Wait**: Then listen.

### 2. "I" Statements
- **Bad**: "You are lazy." (Accusatory, attacks identity).
- **Good**: "I feel stressed when the files are late because I have to work overtime." (Descriptive, focuses on impact).

### 3. Psychological Safety
Google found that the #1 trait of effective teams was "Psychological Safety"—the belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up.
- You build this by admitting mistakes and inviting feedback.

## Activities
1.  **The Pause**: Next time you feel angry/defensive, force yourself to count to 10. Ask: "What is the threat here?"

## Assignment: Scripting the Hard Talk
**Scenario**: Your manager keeps assigning you AI tasks at 5 PM on Fridays, ruining your weekend plans.
1.  Write a script using SBI to address this on Monday morning.
2.  Propose a solution (e.g., "Can we set a Friday noon cutoff?").
3.  Submit the script.
