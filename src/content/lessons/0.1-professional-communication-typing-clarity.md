# Professional Communication: Typing & Clarity

## Introduction
In the digital economy, writing is your primary interface with the world. Whether it's a Slack message, an email, or a documentation file, your words represent you. The ability to type fast allows you to communicate at the "speed of thought," removing the friction between your ideas and the screen.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Power of Touch Typing
If you "hunt and peck" (search for keys with two fingers), your brain is spending energy on finding letters instead of formulating thoughts. Touch typing moves this process to muscle memory.
- **Goal**: 40 Words Per Minute (WPM) is the minimum standard for most professional roles.
- **Benefit**: Saves hundreds of hours per year and reduces cognitive load.

### 2. Clarity & Brevity (BLUF)
Professional communication respects the reader's time. Use the **BLUF** method: **Bottom Line Up Front**.
- **Don't**: Write a 3-paragraph story before asking for a file.
- **Do**: "Hi Team, I need access to the X folder. Here is why..."

### 3. Tone & Audience
- **Async Communication**: In remote work, you lack facial expressions. Be intentionally kind.
- **The "grandma" test**: If you read your message to your grandmother, would she understand it? Avoid unnecessary jargon.

## Activities
1. **Benchmark**: Go to [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/) and take the 1-minute test. Record your WPM.
2. **Simplify**: Find a complex Wikipedia paragraph. Rewrite it to be half the length but keep the same meaning.

## Assignment: Team Introduction
Imagine you have just joined a new distributed team of AI engineers. You need to write an introduction post for the `#general` Slack channel.

**Requirements:**
- State who you are and your role.
- Mention one professional interest (e.g., "I love optimizing prompts").
- Mention one personal fact (e.g., "I have a cat named Data").
- Keep it under 150 words.
- **Check**: Use the Assessment tool below to verify your tone and clarity.
