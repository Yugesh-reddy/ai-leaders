# Agency: Leading Through Change

## Introduction
The technology landscape is changing faster than traditional education can keep up. Waiting for a "course" to be released means you are already behind. **Agency** is the ability to direct your own learning. With AI, you have a PhD-level tutor in every subject available 24/7.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Feynman Technique (with AI)
Richard Feynman said the best way to understand something is to explain it simply.
- **Prompt**: "Explain [Complex Topic] to me like I am 12 years old."
- **Prompt**: "Now test me. Ask me a question to see if I understood."

### 2. Just-in-Time Learning
Don't learn "Just in Case". Learn "Just in Time".
- Encounter a Python error? Paste it into the AI. "Why is this happening? How do I fix it? Explain the concept so I don't make this mistake again."

### 3. The Co-Pilot Mindset
You are the pilot. The AI is the co-pilot.
- You set the destination.
- You verify the instruments.
- The AI handles the map and the radio.
- **Do not autopilot.** You are still responsible for the landing.

## Activities
1.  **Skills Gap**: Identify a skill you lack but need.
2.  **Curriculum Design**: "Create a 3-day lesson plan for me to learn the basics of [Skill]. Include exercises."

## Assignment: Learn a New Concept
Pick a topic you find intimidating (e.g., "How does the Blockchain work?", "How to read sheet music", "Basic Spanish").
1.  Ask the AI to explain it.
2.  Ask follow-up questions until you *get* it.
3.  Write a brief (3-4 sentence) explanation of the concept in your own words below.
