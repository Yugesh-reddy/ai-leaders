# Resume & Digital Portfolio

## Introduction
In the digital economy, you are a media company of one. Your resume is your brochure, and your portfolio is your product demo. Most hiring managers spend less than 6 seconds scanning a resume. You have very little time to make an impact.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The ATS Bot
Before a human sees your resume, a robot (Applicant Tracking System) reads it.
- **Do**: Use standard headings ("Experience", "Education"). use keywords from the job description.
- **Don't**: Use fancy graphics, weird fonts, or "skill bars" that robots can't read.

### 2. Outcomes over Duties
- **Weak**: "Responsible for writing code."
- **Strong**: "Wrote Python scripts that automated 20 hours of manual work per week."
- **Formula**: "Did X, using Y, resulting in Z."

### 3. The Digital Portfolio
"Show, don't tell."
- A GitHub repo, a WordPress site, or even a well-organized LinkedIn profile.
- Include: Screenshots, links to live projects, and case studies (What was the problem? How did you solve it?).

## Activities
1. **Keyword Match**: Paste a Job Description into an AI. Ask: "What are the top 5 hard skills required here?" Ensure those words appear in your resume.

## Assignment: Artifact Update
1.  **Resume**: Update your resume to include your new AI & WordPress skills.
2.  **Portfolio**: Create a simple page (can be a Notion doc, LinkedIn Featured section, or WordPress page) showcasing 1 project.
3.  Submit links to both.
