# Tech Stack Fluency: Hardware, OS, Software

## Introduction
A chef keeps their knives sharp; a developer keeps their environment optimized. "Tech Stack Fluency" isn't about coding—it's about interacting with your machine so seamlessly that the interface disappears.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Hardware Awareness
You don't need to be an engineer, but you must know what you're working with.
- **CPU (Processor)**: The brain. Determines how fast tasks run.
- **RAM (Memory)**: The workbench. Determines how many apps you can open at once.
- **Storage (SSD/HDD)**: The filing cabinet. Where your files live.

### 2. The Operating System (OS) as a Power User
Whether you are on Mac, Windows, or Linux, you should not be using the mouse for everything.
- **Context Switching**: `Cmd+Tab` (Mac) or `Alt+Tab` (Windows) lets you fly between apps.
- **Spotlight/Search**: Use `Cmd+Space` (Mac) or `Win+S` (Windows) to open apps. Stop looking for icons!

### 3. Browser Hygiene
Your browser is likely your most used app.
- **Bookmarks**: Use folders in your bookmarks bar.
- **Extensions**: Install an ad-blocker (uBlock Origin) and a password manager (Bitwarden/1Password).

## Activities
1. **Shortcut Drill**: Spend 5 minutes forcing yourself to use ONLY the keyboard to navigate between your browser, file explorer, and text editor.
2. **Desktop Zero**: Create a folder named "Archive [Date]" on your desktop. Move EVERYTHING into it. Start fresh.

## Assignment: Environment Audit
1. **Identify Specs**: Find out your computer's RAM and Storage.
2. **Shortcuts**: List 5 keyboard shortcuts you used to find this info or navigate the assignment.
3. **Submit**: Enter this info in the assessment area below.
