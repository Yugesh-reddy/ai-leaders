# Networking & Advocacy

## Introduction
People hire people they know, like, and trust. "Networking" isn't about awkward cocktail parties and business cards. It's about building genuine relationships and being a helpful citizen of your industry.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Strength of Weak Ties
Sociologist Mark Granovetter found that most people get jobs through "weak ties" (acquaintances), not best friends.
- Your best friends know the same people you know.
- Acquaintances bridge you to *new* worlds and opportunities.

### 2. Informational Interviews
Don't ask for a job. Ask for advice.
- "I admire your career path as an AI Engineer. I'd love to ask 3 questions about how you got started. Do you have 15 minutes for a virtual coffee?"
- Often, these conversations lead to identifying unadvertised roles.

### 3. Give First
Networking feels gross when you only take.
- Send an interesting article to someone.
- Congratulate them on a promotion.
- Offer to help with a small problem.

## Activities
1.  **The 5 List**: Identify 5 people you admire in your field. Follow them on LinkedIn/Twitter. Engage with their posts (don't act like a bot).

## Assignment: The Outreach
Draft a message to a potential mentor (you don't have to send it, but make it real).
1.  **Subject**: "Question from an aspiring [Role]"
2.  **Hook**: "I loved your recent post about..."
3.  **The Ask**: "Could I ask you one question about...?"
4.  Submit the draft.
