# AI Enablement

## Introduction
Building a website is great. Building a system that works *for* you is better. AI Enablement is about connecting your tools (WordPress, Email, CRM, AI) so they talk to each other automatically.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Automation Logic (IFTTT)
"If This, Then That".
- **Trigger**: New Form Submission on WordPress.
- **Action**: Send info to ChatGPT to summarize.
- **Action**: Email summary to the Sales Team.

### 2. No-Code Tools
- **Zapier / Make**: These tools act as the "glue" of the internet. They connect apps that don't natively talk to each other.
- **Plugins**: WordPress has plugins like "Uncanny Automator" that do this inside your site.

### 3. AI Agents
- Instead of just "Chatting," we can build Agents that *do*.
- Example: An Agent that reads your blog, finds outdated stats, and suggests updates.

## Activities
1.  **Map a Workflow**: Draw a diagram of what happens when a customer emails your company. Who reads it? Where does it go?

## Assignment: The Automation Proposal
Identify a boring task you do (e.g., "Copying leads from email to spreadsheet").
1.  **Trigger**: What starts the process? (e.g., "New Email arrives").
2.  **Action 1**: What happens next? (e.g., "Parse text").
3.  **Action 2**: What is the final result? (e.g., "Add row to Google Sheets").
4.  Submit this 3-step plan.
