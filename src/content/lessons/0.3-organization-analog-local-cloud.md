# Organization: Analog, Local, & Cloud

## Introduction
"Where did I put that file?" is the most expensive question in the modern workplace. Organization isn't about being neat; it's about being reliably effective. When you trust your system, you don't have to carry the mental load of remembering everything.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The PARA Method
A popular way to organize digital life (created by Tiago Forte):
- **P**rojects: Short-term efforts with a deadline (e.g., "Website Redesign").
- **A**reas: Long-term responsibilities (e.g., "Finances", "Health").
- **R**esources: Topics vary (e.g., "AI Prompt Library").
- **A**rchive: Completed projects.

### 2. Naming Conventions
Never name a file `final.docx`, `final_v2.docx`, `final_REAL.docx`.
- **Use**: `YYYY-MM-DD_Description_Version`.
- **Example**: `2024-03-15_ProjectProposal_Draft01.pdf`.
- **Why**: Sorting by name automatically sorts by date.

### 3. Cloud vs. Local
- **Local**: For large media files or code you are currently compiling. Fast but risky if drive fails.
- **Cloud (Drive/Dropbox)**: For documents, collaboration, and backups. Essential for team work.

## Activities
1. **Clean Downloads**: Go to your Downloads folder. Delete installers. Move documents to Documents. Empty the rest.
2. **Rename 5 Files**: Find 5 vaguely named files and rename them using the `YYYY-MM-DD` convention.

## Assignment: Project Structure
Imagine you are starting a project called "AI Cookbook". You need to organize recipes, photos, and drafts.
- **Submit**: A text outline of your folder structure.
- **Example**:
  - `/AI_Cookbook`
    - `/Photos`
    - `/Drafts`
    - `README.md`
