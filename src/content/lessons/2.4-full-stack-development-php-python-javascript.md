# Full Stack Development: PHP, Python, & JavaScript

## Introduction
WordPress allows you to build sites without code, but knowing code makes you a wizard. You can break the limits of your theme and build custom functionality.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Frontend Triad
- **HTML (Nouns)**: The skeleton. `<h1>Title</h1>`.
- **CSS (Adjectives)**: The skin. `h1 { color: blue; }`.
- **JavaScript (Verbs)**: The muscles. `button.onClick(alert('Hi'))`.

### 2. The Backend (PHP & Python)
- WordPress is written in **PHP**. It talks to the database (SQL) to fetch your posts and display them.
- **Python** is rarely used directly in WordPress but is the language of AI. We effectively use Python (via AI) to generate code for WordPress.

### 3. The Inspector
Right-click -> "Inspect".
- This tool is your best friend. You can test CSS changes live without breaking the site.
- You can see exactly what HTML is generating the page.

## Activities
1. **Custom CSS**: In WordPress, go to Appearance -> Customize -> Additional CSS. Try hiding an element (`display: none;`) or changing a font size.

## Assignment: CSS Detective
1.  Go to any website.
2.  Right-click an element (like a Headline).
3.  Click "Inspect".
4.  Find the CSS `color` or `font-size` property.
5.  Change it to something obvious (like bright green or 100px).
6.  Submit a screenshot and the CSS code you modified.
