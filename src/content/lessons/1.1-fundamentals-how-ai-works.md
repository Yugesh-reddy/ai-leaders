# AI Fundamentals: How AI Works

## Introduction
Generative AI (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) feels like magic, but it is actually just very advanced statistics. Understanding *how* it works allows you to use it effectively and—crucially—know when NOT to trust it.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Autocomplete on Steroids
At its core, a Large Language Model (LLM) is predicting the next word (or "token") in a sequence.
- It has read the entire internet.
- It asks: "Based on the last 100 words, what is the most likely next word?"
- It does this over and over until a sentence forms.

### 2. Probability vs. Truth
The AI does not "know" facts. It knows semantic relationships.
- If you ask: "Who is the CEO of [Small Company]?"
- It might hallucinate a plausible-sounding name because that name appears often near "CEO" in its training data.
- **Rule**: Verify *everything* factual.

### 3. Context Window
The "Context Window" is how much the AI can remember in the current conversation.
- If the conversation gets too long, it forgets the beginning.
- Modern models have massive windows (1M+ tokens), so you can paste entire books.

## Activities
1. **Hallucination Hunt**: Ask the AI for a biography of a fake person (use a made-up name like "Dr. Flibberflab The Third"). See how confidently it writes a bio.
2. **Temperature Check**: If you can adjust "Temperature" (creativity), set it to 0 for logic tasks and 1 for creative writing.

## Assignment: Explaining Concepts
Write a short paragraph explaining to a 5th grader how an LLM works.
- **Must use**: The analogy of "Predictive Text" or "Autocomplete".
- **Must mention**: It predicts one word at a time.
