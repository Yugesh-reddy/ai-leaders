# Compensation & Living Wages

## Introduction
Money is a tool for freedom. Understanding how compensation works—and having the courage to ask for what you're worth—is a critical life skill. Many people leave thousands of dollars on the table simply because they are afraid to ask.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Living Wage vs. Minimum Wage
- **Minimum Wage**: The legal floor. Often insufficient for a healthy life.
- **Living Wage**: The income needed to cover basic needs (Housing, Food, Health) + Savings + Dignity.
- **Goal**: Always target *at least* a living wage + 20%.

### 2. Market Rate
- You are selling a service (your labor). What is the market price?
- Use sites like Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, or Salary.com.
- Never enter a negotiation without knowing the range.

### 3. Negotiation Basics
- **Timing**: Negotiate *after* they offer the job but *before* you sign.
- **Script**: "I'm really excited about this offer. Based on my research and experience, I was looking for a base salary closer to $X. Is that number flexible?"

## Activities
1. **Budget Audit**: List every monthly expense. Add 20% for "Unexpected Life Events". Multiply by 12. That is your *Survival Number*.

## Assignment: The Life Plan
1.  **Current**: What is your monthly "Survival Number"?
2.  **Target (3 Years)**: What is your monthly income goal to thrive (travel, savings, etc.)?
3.  **The Gap**: How much more do you need to earn?
4.  **The Path**: Identify one role or skill (e.g., "Senior WordPress Dev") that pays that Target amount.
