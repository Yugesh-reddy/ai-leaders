# UI Production

## Introduction
User Interface (UI) design isn't just making things "pretty." It's about communication. A good UI tells the user what is important, what is clickable, and where to go next—all without using words.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
The most important elements should be the biggest, boldest, or most colorful.
- **Headings**: H1 > H2 > H3.
- **Color**: Use your primary brand color for the main "Call to Action" (Button), not for background noise.

### 2. Spacing (Whitespace)
Whitespace is not empty space; it is an active design element.
- **Crowded**: Hard to read, feels cheap.
- **Spacious**: Easy to scan, feels premium.
- **Rule**: Give elements room to breathe.

### 3. Alignment
Every element on the page should be aligned with something else.
- **Grid**: Using columns helps keep things organized.
- **Left Align**: Generally easier to read for long text than Center Align.

## Activities
1. **Bad Design Hunt**: Go to `r/CrappyDesign` or `webpagesthatsuck.com`. Identify *why* meaningful they fail (e.g., "Low contrast text," "Misaligned buttons").

## Assignment: UI Critique
Find a website (it can be a local business or a big brand).
1.  Take a screenshot.
2.  Identify 1 thing they did **well** (e.g., "Good use of whitespace").
3.  Identify 1 thing to **improve** (e.g., "The button color blends in too much").
4.  Submit your critique.
