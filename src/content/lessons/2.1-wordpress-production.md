# WordPress Production

## Introduction
WordPress is the operating system of the open web. It powers everything from personal blogs to The New York Times. Learning WordPress gives you the power to publish to the entire world without needing a gatekeeper.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Posts vs. Pages
- **Posts**: Timely entries. (e.g., "News", "Blog", "Updates"). Displayed in reverse chronological order.
- **Pages**: Static content. (e.g., "About", "Contact", "Services"). Living indefinitely in the menu.

### 2. The Block Editor (Gutenberg)
WordPress uses "blocks" for everything.
- A paragraph is a block. An image is a block.
- **Slash Command**: Type `/` to instantly search for blocks (e.g., `/image`, `/columns`).
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder your content easily.

### 3. Categories vs. Tags
- **Categories**: File folders. (Broad topics like "AI", "News"). Hierarchical.
- **Tags**: Index keywords. (Specifics like "ChatGPT", "Tutorial"). Flat.

## Activities
1. **Recreate**: Take a screenshot of a simple news site article. Try to recreate the layout exactly in a new WordPress Post using Columns and Image blocks.

## Assignment: Publish a Post
Create a new Post titled "My First AI Leaders Post".
1.  Add a **Cover Image**.
2.  Write an **Introduction** (Paragraph block).
3.  Add a **Heading** (H2 block).
4.  Insert a **Quote** block with a favorite saying.
5.  Link to an external website.
6.  Publish it and submit the URL (or screenshot) below.
