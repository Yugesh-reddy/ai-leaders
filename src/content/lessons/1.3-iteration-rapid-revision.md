learning_objective: "I can use AI to generate multiple ideas and improve upon the best."

essential_questions: "1. How can I guide the AI to improve its own work?\n2. What specific feedback changes the result?\n3. Am I settling for 'good enough'?"
assessment_project: "Generate an email draft, then iterate on it 3 times with different constraints (shorter, more professional, include a joke)."
mastery_criteria: "1. Evidence of 3 distinct versions of the artifact.\n2. Prompt history shows directional feedback ('Make it shorter').\n3. Final version is high quality."
activities: "1. Write a prompt. 2. Critique the output. 3. Ask AI to fix the specific issues. Repeat."

# Iteration: Rapid Revision

## Introduction
Writing is rewriting. In the past, rewriting took hours. With AI, it takes seconds. This allows you to explore the "Idea Space" much more broadly. Instead of writing one email, you can generate 5 variations and pick the best parts of each.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Feedback Loop
Don't just accept the first response. Talk to the model.
- **User**: "Write a cover letter."
- **AI**: (Writes a generic, boring letter.)
- **User**: "That's too formal. Make it sound enthusiastic and mention my experience with Python specifically."
- **AI**: (Writes a better version.)

### 2. Multi-Shot Prompting
Give the AI examples of what you want.
- "Here are 3 distinct examples of good headlines. Write 5 new headlines following this style."

### 3. A/B Testing
Ask for variety in a single prompt.
- "Give me 3 options for this email subject line: one professional, one urgent, and one funny."

## Activities
1. **The Critic**: Ask the AI to write a short story. Then ask it: "Critique this story. What is weak about the plot?"
2. **The Fixer**: Then say: "Rewrite the story addressing those weaknesses."

## Assignment: Iterative Email
Scenario: You need to email a client to delay a deadline.
1.  **Draft 1**: Ask AI to write the email.
2.  **Revision**: Tell the AI: "Too apologetic. Be firm but professional. Propose a new specific date."
3.  **Final Polish**: "Make it under 100 words."
4.  Submit the final version and a brief note on what you changed.
