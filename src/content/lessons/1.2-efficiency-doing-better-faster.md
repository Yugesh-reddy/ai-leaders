# Efficiency: Doing Better, Faster

## Introduction
The easiest way to get value from AI is "Drudgery Removal." If a task is boring, repetitive, or involves transforming data from format A to format B, AI is likely better at it than you are.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Transformation Tasks
AI is incredible at changing the *shape* of information without changing the *meaning*.
- **Summarization**: "TL;DR this email thread."
- **Formatting**: "Turn this list of names into a CSV table."
- **Translation**: "Rewrite this Python code in JavaScript." or "Translate this into French."

### 2. The "0 to 1" Problem
AI is great at going from 0 (blank page) to 0.8 (Rough Draft).
- It is often terrible at going from 0.9 to 1.0 (Final Polish).
- **Strategy**: Use AI to generate the first draft, then use your human expertise to edit and finalize.

### 3. Prompt Engineering Basics
- **Persona**: "Act as a Senior Editor..."
- **Task**: "Summarize this text..."
- **Constraint**: "In exactly 3 bullet points, under 50 words each."

## Activities
1. **Meeting Notes**: Find a transcript or a long email thread.
2. **The Prompt**: "Act as a project manager. Read the text below. Extract all 'Action Items' into a checklist. Extract all 'Key Decisions' into a bulleted list."

## Assignment: Summarization
Find a news article or a long piece of text (500 words+).
1.  Ask the AI to summary it in 3 sentences.
2.  Ask the AI to create a table of "Key Entities" mentioned (People, Organizations, Locations).
3.  Paste the result below.
