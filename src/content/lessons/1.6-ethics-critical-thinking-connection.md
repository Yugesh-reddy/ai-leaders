# Ethics: Critical Thinking & Connection

## Introduction: Ethics = Job Security

Here's the truth nobody tells you: **AI ethics isn't abstract philosophy—it's what keeps you employed.**

Companies fire people who embarrass them with AI. Freelancers lose clients when AI mistakes go public. Your professional reputation is built on trust, and AI can destroy that trust in seconds if you're not careful.

Think of ethics as your **professional insurance policy**. The few minutes you spend checking your work can save you from:
- Getting fired for publishing biased content
- Legal trouble from copyright issues
- Losing clients who feel deceived
- Going viral for the wrong reasons

> **The Bottom Line**: In a world where everyone has access to AI, the people who use it *responsibly* will stand out. Ethics isn't a limitation—it's your competitive advantage.

## 1. Bias: AI Can Get You In Trouble

AI learns from the internet. The internet contains... everything. Racism, sexism, stereotypes—it's all in there. AI companies try to filter this out, but they're not perfect. Not even close.

### Real Cases That Made Headlines

**Hiring AI Gone Wrong (2025)**  
A company called Workday is facing a massive lawsuit because their AI hiring tool was rejecting qualified candidates based on their names, ages, and disabilities. The AI learned patterns from biased historical data and repeated those biases at scale. Qualified people never even got interviews.

**Healthcare AI That Prioritized Wrong (2024)**  
A healthcare AI used by hospitals across the U.S. was trained on *cost data* instead of *health data*. The result? It recommended less follow-up care for Black patients—even when they were sicker than white patients. The AI saw that historically, less money was spent on Black patients, and learned to continue that pattern.

**Resume Screening That Favored Names (2024)**  
Researchers found that AI resume screeners favored white-associated names 85% of the time and male names 52% of the time—when all the qualifications were identical.

### Why This Matters For You

If you're building a website, writing content, or creating images for a client using AI, **you're responsible for the output**. "The AI did it" is not an excuse your client will accept.

### 🎯 Activity: Bias Audit

Try this right now:
1. Ask an AI image generator to create a "successful entrepreneur"
2. Generate 5-10 images
3. Look at the results: What's the gender? Race? Age? Body type?
4. Now try "hardworking employee" vs "lazy worker"—notice any patterns?

This isn't about being the "woke police." It's about catching problems *before* you show work to a client or publish something publicly.

## 2. Deepfakes: Don't Get Fooled, Don't Fool Others

We're living in a world where **seeing is no longer believing**. AI can now create fake videos of real people saying things they never said. Fake photos that look completely real. Synthetic voices that sound exactly like someone you know.

This matters for your career because:
- Scammers use deepfakes to impersonate executives and steal money
- Fake references and recommendations are becoming more common
- Misinformation spreads faster than truth

### How to Spot AI-Generated Content

![Spot AI Fakes: 4 Quick Checks infographic showing how to identify AI-generated images by checking fingers, lighting, background text, and trusting your instincts](/images/lessons/1.6/deepfake-detection.png)

**The Hands Test**  
AI still struggles with hands. Count the fingers. Look for:
- Too many digits
- Fused or twisted fingers
- Joints that bend the wrong way

**Lighting & Shadows**  
Look for shadows that don't match the light source. Reflections in glasses or mirrors that don't make sense.

**"Uncanny Valley" Feeling**  
If something feels *slightly* off but you can't explain why—trust that instinct. Your brain is picking up on subtle wrongness.

**Background Weirdness**  
AI often generates nonsensical backgrounds: words that aren't quite words, objects that morph into each other, chairs with wrong numbers of legs.

### Tools You Can Use (Free)

- **TrueMedia.org** - Upload images to check for AI manipulation
- **Google Lens** - Reverse image search to find original sources
- **Hive AI** - Detects AI-generated content

### 🎯 Activity: Deepfake Hunt

1. Go to TrueMedia.org
2. Find a suspicious-looking image online (or one you're unsure about)
3. Upload it and check the results
4. Practice this skill—it'll only become more important

## 3. Your AI Has a Carbon Footprint

Every AI query uses electricity. Lots of it. The data centers that run ChatGPT need massive cooling systems that consume water. This isn't about feeling guilty—it's about being aware.

### The Numbers

![Your AI's Carbon Footprint infographic comparing 1 Google search to 10x impact of ChatGPT query and water bottle equivalent per 100-word prompt](/images/lessons/1.6/ai-carbon-footprint.png)

| What You Do | Environmental Impact |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 Google search | ~0.0003 kWh |
| 1 ChatGPT query | ~0.003 kWh (**10x a Google search**) |
| 100-word AI prompt | ~1 bottle of water for cooling |
| All AI in 2025 | 80 million tonnes of CO2 (equal to New York City's annual emissions) |

### What This Means For You

**Think of a "Query Budget"**

Just like you wouldn't leave all the lights on in your house, consider:
- Do I need AI for this, or can I Google it?
- Can I combine multiple questions into one prompt?
- Am I running the same query over and over when I could save the answer?

This isn't about never using AI. It's about using it *intentionally*—just like turning off lights when you leave a room.

## 4. Who Owns What You Make with AI?

This one gets legally complicated fast. Here's what you need to know:

### The Big Lawsuits (2024-2025)

**Getty Images vs Stability AI**  
Getty sued Stability AI for using millions of copyrighted images to train their AI—without permission or payment. The case is still affecting how AI companies operate worldwide.

**Music Industry Lawsuits**  
Major record labels sued AI music generators for training on copyrighted songs without permission. Artists from Elton John to Dua Lipa are fighting for their rights.

### What This Means For Your Work

**AI-Only Content May Not Be Copyrightable**  
The U.S. Copyright Office ruled in 2025 that content generated entirely by AI (with minimal human input) cannot be copyrighted. If you want to protect your work, you need significant human creative contribution.

**Using Others' Work Without Permission = Risk**  
If you feed an AI someone else's copyrighted work (like making it "write in the style of" a specific author using their actual text), you could be creating legal liability.

### 🎯 Job Scenario

> *Your client asks you to use AI to create a logo "inspired by" Nike's swoosh. What do you do?*

The safe answer: Explain the trademark risks and suggest original alternatives. AI makes copying easy—that doesn't make it legal or ethical.

---

## 5. Tell People You Used AI

Transparency builds trust. Hiding AI use can destroy it.

### Simple Rule

If AI significantly contributed to your work, say so. It's becoming the professional standard—like citing sources in school.

### How to Disclose

**Professional and Accepted:**
- "This article was drafted with AI assistance and edited by [Your Name]."
- "Images created with Midjourney, styled and selected by author."
- "Research assisted by ChatGPT; all facts verified independently."

**What NOT to Do:**
- Pass off AI work as entirely your own on a job application
- Use AI to write academic papers without disclosure (if your school prohibits it)
- Create fake testimonials or reviews using AI

### EU AI Act (2024)

It's now *legally required* in Europe to label AI-generated content that could be mistaken for human-made. This is coming to more countries. The watermarking and disclosure requirements are becoming standard.

### Why Disclosure Helps You

- Clients appreciate honesty
- Sets realistic expectations about revisions
- Protects you if something goes wrong ("I disclosed AI was used")
- Builds long-term trust

## 6. The Human Loop: When AI Should Never Decide Alone

Some decisions are too important to leave to AI unsupervised.

### Never Let AI Alone Handle:

- **Hiring/firing decisions** - Always have a human review
- **Medical advice** - AI should support doctors, not replace them
- **Legal judgments** - AI can research, humans must decide
- **Financial decisions about individuals** - Loans, insurance, etc.
- **Content that could harm someone's reputation**

### The "Confident Intern" Test

> *Would you trust a very confident intern with this task, unsupervised?*

If the answer is no, then you shouldn't trust AI unsupervised either. AI is like that intern: sometimes brilliant, sometimes confidently wrong, and always in need of human oversight for anything important.

## 7. Your Ethics Cheat Sheet

Before you publish or deliver AI-assisted work, run through these 5 questions:

![5-Question AI Ethics Check infographic showing Boss/Client Test, Bias Check, Human Review, Transparency, and Golden Rule](/images/lessons/1.6/ethics-cheat-sheet.png)

### ✅ The 5-Question Ethics Check

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Would I be embarrassed if my boss/client saw this prompt?** | Keeps you professional |
| 2 | **Did I check for bias and stereotypes in the output?** | Protects reputation |
| 3 | **Is a human reviewing high-stakes content?** | Prevents disasters |
| 4 | **Am I being transparent about AI assistance?** | Builds trust |
| 5 | **Am I treating others' work the way I'd want mine treated?** | The golden rule |

### The WWATD Test

**Would I Want AI To Decide this about me?**

If you're using AI to make decisions that affect other people, flip the script. Would you be comfortable if an AI was making this decision about *your* job application, *your* healthcare, *your* loan?
