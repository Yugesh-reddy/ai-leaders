# Ethics: Critical Thinking & Connection

## Introduction
"With great power comes great responsibility." AI is a lever; it multiplies your intent. It can multiply creativity, or it can multiply spam, misinformation, and bias. Being an AI Leader means using this tool conscientiously.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Bias in the Machine
Models are trained on the internet. The internet contains racism, sexism, and hate.
- Models try to filter this, but they aren't perfect.
- **Example**: Ask for images of "Productive Workers" vs "Lazy Workers". Check the demographics. Always critique the output for stereotypes.

### 2. Hallucination & Misinformation
AI can sound very confident while being completely wrong.
- Spreading AI-generated falsehoods destroys trust.
- **Rule**: If you publish it, you verify it.

### 3. The Human Loop
- Never put AI in charge of high-stakes decisions (hiring, firing, medical diagnoses) without a human in the loop.
- **Deepfakes**: We are entering an era where seeing is not believing. Critical thinking is your defense.

## Activities
1.  **Bias Audit**: Ask the AI to write a story about a "Doctor" and a "Nurse". Did it assign genders? (e.g., He=Doctor, She=Nurse).
2.  **Attribution**: If you use AI to write a report, should you cite it? (Yes, usually "Assisted by AI").

## Assignment: Ethical Review
Imagine you are deploying an AI Chatbot for a Customer Service line.
1.  List 3 risks (e.g., "The bot might be rude," "The bot might promise refunds we can't give").
2.  List 3 safeguards (e.g., "Human supervisor," "Limit answers to a knowledge base").
3.  Submit your risk/safeguard list.
