# Creativity: Expanding Human Potential

## Introduction
Creativity is often defined as connecting unconnected things. LLMs have "connected" the entire internet in their latent space. This makes them the ultimate brainstorming partner. They never get tired, they never judge your bad ideas, and they can generate 100 concepts in the time it takes you to think of one.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Divergent vs. Convergent Thinking
- **Divergent (AI Strength)**: "Give me 20 ideas for..." "What are 10 impossible solutions to..."
- **Convergent (Human Strength)**: "Which of these is feasible?" "Which matches our brand voice?"

### 2. Hallucinating Creativity
Sometimes you *want* the AI to hallucinate.
- "Describe a color that doesn't exist."
- "Write a poem about quantum physics in the style of Dr. Seuss."
- These novel combinations can spark real human inspiration.

### 3. Breaking Writer's Block
The blank page is the enemy.
- never start from scratch.
- "Give me an outline."
- "Give me 5 opening sentences."
- "Review my half-finished draft and suggest 3 endings."

## Activities
1. **Roleplay**: "Act as a hostile journalist. Interview me about my new startup idea. Ask hard questions."
2. **Concept Mashup**: "Invent a new sport that combines Chess and Rock Climbing. Explain the rules."

## Assignment: Brainstorm to Outline
1.  **Diverge**: Ask the AI for 10 blog post titles about " The Future of Remote Work".
2.  **Converge**: Pick your favorite one.
3.  **Expand**: Ask the AI to write a detailed outline for that chosen title, including H2 headers and key points for each section.
4.  Submit the Title and Outline.
