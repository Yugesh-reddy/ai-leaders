# Prioritization: Motivation, Planning, & Focus

## Introduction
In a world of infinite notifications, attention is your scarcest resource. Prioritization is the art of deciding what *not* to do. It is easy to spend all day answering emails and feel "productive" while having accomplished nothing of long-term value.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Eisenhower Matrix
Categorize tasks into four boxes:
1.  **Urgent & Important**: Do it now. (Crises, Deadlines)
2.  **Not Urgent & Important**: Schedule it. (Learning, Strategy, Exercise) -> **This is where growth happens.**
3.  **Urgent & Not Important**: Delegate it. (Interruptions, Some meetings)
4.  **Not Urgent & Not Important**: Delete it. (Scroll holes, busywork)

### 2. Eat the Frog
Mark Twain said, "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning."
- Do your hardest, most anxiety-inducing task **first**. Once it's done, the rest of the day is easy.

### 3. Timeboxing
Don't just write a to-do list; give tasks a home on your calendar.
- "Write Report" -> Schedule it for 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM.
- If it's not on the calendar, it's just a wish.

## Activities
1. **Pomodoro Timer**: Pick one task. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Do NOTHING else until it rings.
2. **Notification Purge**: Turn off non-essential notifications on your phone for 1 hour.

## Assignment: The Plan
Looking at your goals for this week:
1.  Identify your "Frog" (Hardest task).
2.  Identify 2 "Important but not Urgent" tasks.
3.  Submit your plan for tomorrow.
