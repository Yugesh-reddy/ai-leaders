# Measuring Impact: Analysis & Visualization

## Introduction
Effort does not equal impact. You can work hard for weeks and achieve nothing if you are pushing in the wrong direction. Measuring impact is about defining "Success" before you start and tracking your progress towards it.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Lagging vs. Leading Indicators
- **Lagging Indicator**: Looking effectively backward. (e.g., "We lost 5 lbs this month"). It's too late to change it.
- **Leading Indicator**: Predictive inputs. (e.g., "Calories eaten today", "Minutes exercised"). You can influence these *now*.
- **Strategy**: Track leading indicators to influence lagging results.

### 2. SMART Goals
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable (Must have a number)
- **A**chievable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-bound

### 3. Basic Visualization
Don't use a pie chart (usually).
- **Line Chart**: Trends over time (Use for progress).
- **Bar Chart**: Comparing categories (Use for ranking).
- **Spreadsheets**: Learn the basics of `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, and Conditional Formatting.

## Activities
1. **Habit Tracker**: Open a spreadsheet. Put dates in Column A. Put "Miles Run" or "Pages Read" in Column B. Create a simple Line Chart.

## Assignment: Define Success
Choose a personal or professional project (e.g., "Learning AI" or "Getting Fit").
1.  Define a **SMART Goal**.
2.  Define one **Leading Indicator** you will track daily.
3.  Explain how you will visualize this (e.g., "I will use a line chart to show pages read per day").
